# README

Idea for rGMS was to rewrite GMS using something that seams to better match Genieacs than PHP.
I decided to use Ruby on rail because it was completly new framework and runing it might be easir than instaling LAMP (for GenieACS user).

rGMS API is very limited, in fact it requires more development to be used in easy way. Reading data using JSON is possible but not very practical at this poin.

# Run it
In folder containing project install database changes than run rails server.

Without any external interest in this solution. I do not plan devoting any time to this project.
